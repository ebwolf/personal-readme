## Personal Development
### What I value

### My expectations of my BUD (mentor/mentee)

I am an experienced mentor, while I can and will guide you through a tech project. I prefer a more "touchy-feely" style of mentorship where I will listen to your concerns and help you make these your strengths. I am especially experienced with mentoring women and non-binary people of color (POC). My expectations are simple: communicate with me (email, whatsapp, Signal, Telegram, Threema, IG, etc.) 

### What you can expect of me

I will be your biggest cheerleader. I will always encourage you in a way that is authentic. I want you to succeed.

### WARNING!

I am not from a hugging family and I am autistic. I may put out "don't hug me vibes" but I really like being hugged. I used to say only people who knew me as Tia (my roller derby name) could hug me. Then I expanded this to anyone who's seen all of my tattoos. Now it is basically anyone who is comfortable with hugging. Do not feel pressured if you aren't a hugger. I'll never instigate a hug.
